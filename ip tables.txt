TABLES
There are currently five independent tables (which tables are present at any time depends on the kernel configuration options and which modules are present).

-t, --table table
    This option specifies the packet matching table which the command should operate on. If the kernel is configured with automatic module loading, an attempt will be made to load the appropriate module for that table if it is not already there.

    The tables are as follows:

        filter:
            This is the default table (if no -t option is passed). It contains the built-in chains INPUT (for packets destined to local sockets), FORWARD (for packets being routed through the box), and OUTPUT (for locally-generated packets). 
        nat:
            This table is consulted when a packet that creates a new connection is encountered. It consists of three built-ins: PREROUTING (for altering packets as soon as they come in), OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before routing), and POSTROUTING (for altering packets as they are about to go out). 
        mangle:
            This table is used for specialized packet alteration. Until kernel 2.4.17 it had two built-in chains: PREROUTING (for altering incoming packets before routing) and OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before routing). Since kernel 2.4.18, three other built-in chains are also supported: INPUT (for packets coming into the box itself), FORWARD (for altering packets being routed through the box), and POSTROUTING (for altering packets as they are about to go out). 
        raw:
            This table is used mainly for configuring exemptions from connection tracking in combination with the NOTRACK target. It registers at the netfilter hooks with higher priority and is thus called before ip_conntrack, or any other IP tables. It provides the following built-in chains: PREROUTING (for packets arriving via any network interface) OUTPUT (for packets generated by local processes) 
        security:
            This table is used for Mandatory Access Control (MAC) networking rules, such as those enabled by the SECMARK and CONNSECMARK targets. Mandatory Access Control is implemented by Linux Security Modules such as SELinux. The security table is called after the filter table, allowing any Discretionary Access Control (DAC) rules in the filter table to take effect before MAC rules. This table provides the following built-in chains: INPUT (for packets coming into the box itself), OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before routing), and FORWARD (for altering packets being routed through the box). 

 
OPTIONS
The options that are recognized by iptables can be divided into several different groups.  
COMMANDS
These options specify the desired action to perform. Only one of them can be specified on the command line unless otherwise stated below. For long versions of the command and option names, you need to use only enough letters to ensure that iptables can differentiate it from all other options.

-A, --append chain rule-specification
    Append one or more rules to the end of the selected chain. When the source and/or destination names resolve to more than one address, a rule will be added for each possible address combination. 
-C, --check chain rule-specification
    Check whether a rule matching the specification does exist in the selected chain. This command uses the same logic as -D to find a matching entry, but does not alter the existing iptables configuration and uses its exit code to indicate success or failure. 
-D, --delete chain rule-specification
-D, --delete chain rulenum
    Delete one or more rules from the selected chain. There are two versions of this command: the rule can be specified as a number in the chain (starting at 1 for the first rule) or a rule to match. 
-I, --insert chain [rulenum] rule-specification
    Insert one or more rules in the selected chain as the given rule number. So, if the rule number is 1, the rule or rules are inserted at the head of the chain. This is also the default if no rule number is specified. 
-R, --replace chain rulenum rule-specification
    Replace a rule in the selected chain. If the source and/or destination names resolve to multiple addresses, the command will fail. Rules are numbered starting at 1. 
-L, --list [chain]
    List all rules in the selected chain. If no chain is selected, all chains are listed. Like every other iptables command, it applies to the specified table (filter is the default), so NAT rules get listed by

     iptables -t nat -n -L

    Please note that it is often used with the -n option, in order to avoid long reverse DNS lookups. It is legal to specify the -Z (zero) option as well, in which case the chain(s) will be atomically listed and zeroed. The exact output is affected by the other arguments given. The exact rules are suppressed until you use

     iptables -L -v

-S, --list-rules [chain]
    Print all rules in the selected chain. If no chain is selected, all chains are printed like iptables-save. Like every other iptables command, it applies to the specified table (filter is the default). 
-F, --flush [chain]
    Flush the selected chain (all the chains in the table if none is given). This is equivalent to deleting all the rules one by one. 
-Z, --zero [chain [rulenum]]
    Zero the packet and byte counters in all chains, or only the given chain, or only the given rule in a chain. It is legal to specify the -L, --list (list) option as well, to see the counters immediately before they are cleared. (See above.) 
-N, --new-chain chain
    Create a new user-defined chain by the given name. There must be no target of that name already. 
-X, --delete-chain [chain]
    Delete the optional user-defined chain specified. There must be no references to the chain. If there are, you must delete or replace the referring rules before the chain can be deleted. The chain must be empty, i.e. not contain any rules. If no argument is given, it will attempt to delete every non-builtin chain in the table. 
-P, --policy chain target
    Set the policy for the chain to the given target. See the section TARGETS for the legal targets. Only built-in (non-user-defined) chains can have policies, and neither built-in nor user-defined chains can be policy targets. 
-E, --rename-chain old-chain new-chain
    Rename the user specified chain to the user supplied name. This is cosmetic, and has no effect on the structure of the table. 
-h
    Help. Give a (currently very brief) description of the command syntax. 

 
PARAMETERS
The following parameters make up a rule specification (as used in the add, delete, insert, replace and append commands).

-4, --ipv4
    This option has no effect in iptables and iptables-restore. 
-6, --ipv6
    If a rule using the -6 option is inserted with (and only with) iptables-restore, it will be silently ignored. Any other uses will throw an error. This option allows to put both IPv4 and IPv6 rules in a single rule file for use with both iptables-restore and ip6tables-restore. 
[!] -p, --protocol protocol
    The protocol of the rule or of the packet to check. The specified protocol can be one of tcp, udp, udplite, icmp, esp, ah, sctp or the special keyword "all", or it can be a numeric value, representing one of these protocols or a different one. A protocol name from /etc/protocols is also allowed. A "!" argument before the protocol inverts the test. The number zero is equivalent to all. "all" will match with all protocols and is taken as default when this option is omitted. 
[!] -s, --source address[/mask][,...]
    Source specification. Address can be either a network name, a hostname, a network IP address (with /mask), or a plain IP address. Hostnames will be resolved once only, before the rule is submitted to the kernel. Please note that specifying any name to be resolved with a remote query such as DNS is a really bad idea. The mask can be either a network mask or a plain number, specifying the number of 1's at the left side of the network mask. Thus, a mask of 24 is equivalent to 255.255.255.0. A "!" argument before the address specification inverts the sense of the address. The flag --src is an alias for this option. Multiple addresses can be specified, but this will expand to multiple rules (when adding with -A), or will cause multiple rules to be deleted (with -D). 
[!] -d, --destination address[/mask][,...]
    Destination specification. See the description of the -s (source) flag for a detailed description of the syntax. The flag --dst is an alias for this option. 
-m, --match match
    Specifies a match to use, that is, an extension module that tests for a specific property. The set of matches make up the condition under which a target is invoked. Matches are evaluated first to last as specified on the command line and work in short-circuit fashion, i.e. if one extension yields false, evaluation will stop. 
-j, --jump target
    This specifies the target of the rule; i.e., what to do if the packet matches it. The target can be a user-defined chain (other than the one this rule is in), one of the special builtin targets which decide the fate of the packet immediately, or an extension (see EXTENSIONS below). If this option is omitted in a rule (and -g is not used), then matching the rule will have no effect on the packet's fate, but the counters on the rule will be incremented. 
-g, --goto chain
    This specifies that the processing should continue in a user specified chain. Unlike the --jump option return will not continue processing in this chain but instead in the chain that called us via --jump. 
[!] -i, --in-interface name
    Name of an interface via which a packet was received (only for packets entering the INPUT, FORWARD and PREROUTING chains). When the "!" argument is used before the interface name, the sense is inverted. If the interface name ends in a "+", then any interface which begins with this name will match. If this option is omitted, any interface name will match. 
[!] -o, --out-interface name
    Name of an interface via which a packet is going to be sent (for packets entering the FORWARD, OUTPUT and POSTROUTING chains). When the "!" argument is used before the interface name, the sense is inverted. If the interface name ends in a "+", then any interface which begins with this name will match. If this option is omitted, any interface name will match. 
[!] -f, --fragment
    This means that the rule only refers to second and further fragments of fragmented packets. Since there is no way to tell the source or destination ports of such a packet (or ICMP type), such a packet will not match any rules which specify them. When the "!" argument precedes the "-f" flag, the rule will only match head fragments, or unfragmented packets. 
-c, --set-counters packets bytes
    This enables the administrator to initialize the packet and byte counters of a rule (during INSERT, APPEND, REPLACE operations). 

 
OTHER OPTIONS
The following additional options can be specified:

-v, --verbose
    Verbose output. This option makes the list command show the interface name, the rule options (if any), and the TOS masks. The packet and byte counters are also listed, with the suffix 'K', 'M' or 'G' for 1000, 1,000,000 and 1,000,000,000 multipliers respectively (but see the -x flag to change this). For appending, insertion, deletion and replacement, this causes detailed information on the rule or rules to be printed. -v may be specified multiple times to possibly emit more detailed debug statements. 
-w, --wait
    Wait for the xtables lock. To prevent multiple instances of the program from running concurrently, an attempt will be made to obtain an exclusive lock at launch. By default, the program will exit if the lock cannot be obtained. This option will make the program wait until the exclusive lock can be obtained. 
-n, --numeric
    Numeric output. IP addresses and port numbers will be printed in numeric format. By default, the program will try to display them as host names, network names, or services (whenever applicable). 
-x, --exact
    Expand numbers. Display the exact value of the packet and byte counters, instead of only the rounded number in K's (multiples of 1000) M's (multiples of 1000K) or G's (multiples of 1000M). This option is only relevant for the -L command. 
--line-numbers
    When listing rules, add line numbers to the beginning of each rule, corresponding to that rule's position in the chain. 
--modprobe=command
    When adding or inserting rules into a chain, use command to load any necessary modules (targets, match extensions, etc).
